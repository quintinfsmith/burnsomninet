# Intro
Radix notation came predominantly from one idea. I don't like the arbirary and c-major-centric nature of current the current staff of western music. I *could* have researched more standards from other cultures, but I'm a programmer; I *make* standards. Why would I try to learn another standard and try to adjust my sense of musical structures in order to express myself? The answer is obviously "That's what communication is, you twat". And that's fair, but I've never seen music as communication (ie, not a universal language) but a tool of self expression. So this is a system born of my own needs and the way *I* look at music.

1) I don't like calling notes 'sharp' or 'flat' when they are as equally valid and unspecialized as any other note in the set of playable notes. I think this was the #1 concept that blocked my musical progression in its early days.
2) I don't want to be limited to 12 notes, but I *do* like the idea of playing from fixed-sized sets of notes, like having a palette to pick from.
3) I never liked the lack of symmetry on the grand staff. Because the standard 12-tones is an even number of notes, a note will alternate between being on a line and a space as you change octaves.
4) I think time signatures are obstructions to feeling the music. I always found the denominator of a time-signature to be arbitrary and anything other than a 4 is hipster nonsense. (7 / 5 isn't actually irrational, just harder to draw and therefor read.)
5) I don't like including dynamics in the notation. I also see duration of note presses a dynamic and not really part of the musical structure.
6) I don't like 'chords'. I prefer to look at simultaneous notes as harmonizations and the emergent properties thereof. Which, in my mind, means that each note needs to be specifically placed rather than placed as an afterthought of some chord.

7) I want to be able to use text-editor to edit a piece
