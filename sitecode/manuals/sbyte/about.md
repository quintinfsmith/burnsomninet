# About
It's a byte editor. It's console-based. I don't *think* it sucks.

## Features
- Hexadecimal, Binary and Decimal views
- Configurable controls
- Vi-ish environment
- Regex-ish searching


## Planned Features
- Extensibility with Python
- Relative-sequence-based searching (ie. You don't know the initial value but you know the [pro|pre]ceeding relative bytes)
- Data marking: Set a byte or chunk as a checksum, pointer, etc.
- Scriptability: Use the functionality of sbyte just by running a script.
