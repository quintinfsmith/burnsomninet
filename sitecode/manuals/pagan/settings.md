# Settings

## Change SoundFont
From here you can either select an imported .sf2 file or select 'import' and use a soundfont from your device. By default, a message will appear if you have no soundfonts, providing a link to the Fluid R3 general midi soundfont on the internet archive.

## Toggle Relative Controls
Pagan has the option to set notes based on preceding notes(eg +1, -3, etc). This can control can be enabled here. Projects with relative notes are still viewable if this option is not enabled.
