# A quick note from the creator

If you like standard western notation and don't see a problem with it, that's great and Pagan's probably not for you. Honestly, it may not be for anyone other than me. Current standard notation just don't work for me. I've spent years using it. I can read it and I understand it, but it still doesn't work with how I think about music. If this isn't true for you, then I recommend sticking with it.

However, **if you think music should be more like a spreadsheet or maybe you refuse to learn braille because it's not binary**, then I may have something for you...
