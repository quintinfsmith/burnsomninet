# Some Basics

## Chords
Pagan only allows 1 note per line. So to add a chord, insert as many lines as you need notes in the chord (eg 2 more fore a standard triad) and insert the other tones one under the other.

## Copying section
Pagan doesn't *currently* support straight copy-paste behaviour. However, this can still be done via linking/unlinking sections of beats.
    1. Select range by long-tapping where you want your top-left and bottom-right corners of the selection.
    2. Tap the beat of the top-left corner where you want to paste a copy of this section to.
    3. If you want to keep these sections identical, you're done. Any changes made to onewill happen to the other now. If you don't want them to be identical, unlink them by reselecting the pasted range and tap the unlink button. Be careful here as unlink-all will unlink all copies made of this section and the unlink button will only unlink the selection.
