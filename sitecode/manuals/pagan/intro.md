# Introduction

There are 2 core ideas that Pagan centers on:

1. Radix Notation

    A radix (or base) is the number of numerals used to group numbers. The current western standard is 10 (0-9), but any number can be represented with any radix. For example, others are used often in computer science, specifically 2 (binary code) and 16 (hexidecimal).

   Standard western notation uses 12 notes per octave and assumes each note is equally space (though sometimes this isn't the case. If you don't understand this, you don't need to to use Pagan. if you do then get off my back, I pointed it out)

    This means that each octave up can be represent with a number and each note can be represented with another.  For example (starting at A) A4 in western notation would be 40 in radix-12 notation.Some other examples to help drive home the point would be C3 -> 33, F#2 -> 29 & Bb1 -> 11 because C is 3 notes (NOT STEPS/ Half-Steps) Up from A, F# is 9 Up & Bb is 1.

    To me, the advantage to this is immediately appearent:

    - The terms "step" and "half-step" are no longer used
    - The terms "sharp" and "flat" wouldn't be used. *They are only difference in western notation because of arbitrary naming conventions.*
    - It's easier to immediately recognize specific notes
    - It's easier to transpose (just start from any note and count up from that instead of A)


2. Visual Rhythm
    Instead of grouping by measure, each column represents a beat.
    Each beat can be arbitrarily divided into equal parts and those parts can be divided and so on.
