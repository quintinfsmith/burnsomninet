# F.A.Q.

## What's a Radix?
A radix is the number by which you group when counting. If you are part of most of the modern world, you'll be familiar with radix-10, in which we count in groups of 10 numerals.
Binary is radix 2 and hexidecimal is radix 16.
Pianos are implicitly radix 12. Even if western music thinks of notes as letters rather than numbers.
