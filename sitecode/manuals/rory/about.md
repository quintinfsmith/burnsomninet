# About
It may look like a game, but Rory is a tool made to help in learning to play piano. The idea isn't to replace notation, but to free a new player from having to learn 2 skills at once (physically playing *and* sight reading). With Rory, you can focus on just getting the muscle memory.

At every new note, the roll will stop and wait for the correct input from the midi device.

Highlighted notes are sharps, otherwise they are naturals.

Each track will display as a different color. This allows for delineation between left and right hands.

The active line will be a double line when it lands on a beat and a single line otherwise.

Rory will attempt to to label any chords played. This feature is still a work in progress.
